Project feedback, bug reports and comments are welcomed over at our discord server: https://discord.gg/XVZbNan <br>

**Notes:**<br>
① Donations are welcome!<br>
Keeping a project this big running smoothly really need lots of effort and we put lots of our free times into it.<br>
We will keep on releasing new cars as soon as the game update is rolled out and keep them nice and clean directly extract from the game codes **for free**.<br>
But we could need your help! Donate to this project and help us! Buy us a cup of coffee or a muffin will make our days!<br>
This is 100% optional and you can still use our project for free as usual. <br>
Join our discord channel and ask all about it in the project chatting room!<br>
Thanks for your support and happy racing!<br>
